	<h2>A Little More About Who I Am</h2>
      <section>
	<p>As a native to Montana, I grew up in a very small town and went to an even smaller school where things like coding were unheard of. Despite my interest in everything computer and electronic related, from video games to how animations or websites were built, I went to college at Montana State University and got my bachelors in history.  <br><br>I quickly moved to Colorado graduating and became a fulltime skier where I was able to ski during the day and learn about the vast world of fine dining in the evenings.  Spending several years learning about wine and different types of etiquette around the world, I decided that a change of pace was needed and moved back to Montana to run a pizza restaurant.<br><br>  Working with such an incredibly diverse group of people through the years has given me an appreciation of different cultures and lifestyles.  It is something that has driven me to undertake coding, to see if I can be one of the best, and meet new people with different skills to learn from them what has been an interest of mine since childhood.</p>
